# worker-og

An experiment in creating dynamic images in rust for `og:image` metadata purposes.

This repo is archived because I found a much simpler way of doing things. This repo uses a Rust/WASM Worker to generate images, instead I can use a technique like [worker-og](https://github.com/kvnang/workers-og/) which can be called from JS and uses WASM under the hood
